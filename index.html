            <p>
                I grew up in Lakeland, FL. When I graduated High School, I went to school for Medical Assisting for a year. I worked in the medical field for about 5 years. I then moved to Customer Service and have worked in that field now for over 10 years. I decided to switch my career focus and took a coding bootcamp at UCF. I learned and became fluent in multiple different coding languages including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Node, and many more.

                I look forward to my career path and gaining experience working along fellow developers.
